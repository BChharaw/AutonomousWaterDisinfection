Welcome to the README file for the UVCC Prototype website. This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the UVCC (Ultraviolet Conduit Cell) water sterilization prototype project developed by the 2022 CLK Engineering Idol design team. The website showcases the project's features, design, and functionality.

## Introduction
The UVCC Prototype website is designed to provide information about an autonomous water sterilization system. The website utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to present the features, design process, and technical details of the project.

## Project Overview
The UVCC Prototype is a water sterilization system developed by the 2022 CLK Engineering Idol design team. The goal of the project is to autonomously disinfect pathogen-contaminated water using ultraviolet light. The system is compact, cost-effective, and scalable, capable of sterilizing a large volume of water per day.

## Fluid Analysis Algorithm
The website highlights the fluid analysis algorithm developed in JavaScript. This algorithm uses object-oriented programming to determine the safe flow rate for the system.

## Interactive Flow Rate Visualizer
The interactive flow rate visualizer allows users to adjust various parameters to see how the prototype's disinfection capabilities change. Users can modify values such as pathogen-killing energy, bulb output, bulb efficiency, bulb radius, bulb length, and system radius.
